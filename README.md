This project was made to evaluate final production yield in a shrimp farm with different products: feed brand and automatic feeders.
The results show that feeder D performs better than the others giving 19% higher biomass per hectarea than traditional method and 3% relative to other feeders brand. 
Also, feeder D make posible use 10% lees feed kilograms to produce 1 kg of shrimp than others feeders brand and 11% less than traditional method.
Survillance is also affected by feeding method, showing 5% higher survillance with feeder D than other feeder brand. The last is 0.1% higher than traditional method.
There is no difference between feed brands, so the decision to take shoul be made by the cost of each brand (data no available for this analysis).

This project shows weekly reports from a shrimp farm producer. 
It was made to evaluate general and pond by pond kpi's and compare the yield for each pond and evaluate if there is any deviation from the mean.
Also, shows the trend for each indicator along time by pond. This is helpful to highlight in wich pond there is a deviation from the trend and take decisions to solve it.
